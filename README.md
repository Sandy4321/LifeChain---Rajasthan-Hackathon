# LifeChain---Rajasthan-Hackathon
Our idea deals with the ongoing blood bank frauds in our country. The problem is that
1. Blood units are sold illegally 
2. Some blood banks sell platelettes and plasma extracted from the available blood units hence decreasing the supply of blood in the country 
3. Inventory management of blood banks is poor as there is no transparency in the system 
4. There is no centralized record for the blood donations in the country  

Our solution is awesome because: 
1. We'll use blockchain as a robust database where a committed transaction can't be rolled back and data once written cannot be updated or deleted. 
2. Every participant has access to read database and transactions hence, it provides an idea of the available blood units throughout the country 
3. It can help in inventory management by enforcing a proper FIFO pattern as we can maintain a dated record 
4. As we can have a complete record of donors the money spent by Government in promoting blood donation can be highly personalized. 
5. The system can easily be deployed over the existing system and can be attached with the Rajasthan Government's EHR based on blockchain to save a donor's history. 
6.  The beauty of our idea lies in the fact that instead of centralizing we are decentralizing the complete blood donation system using blockchain - Hyperledger Composer based. 

We are motivated from the Hon'ble Supreme Court's judgement limiting the commerce of blood units involving money. This is a social project which can be highly useful if implemented by the state's government.
